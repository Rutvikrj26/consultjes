You are absolutely right to double-check. The initial catalogue I created was a good high-level summary, but after cross-referencing multiple sitemaps and product pages associated with the company, I found a significantly more detailed and exhaustive list of products.

My previous list was not complete. The company offers a much wider range of products, including many application-specific chillers, chillers sold by specific brands, and related components that were not in the first catalogue.

Here is the revised, more exhaustive product catalogue.
