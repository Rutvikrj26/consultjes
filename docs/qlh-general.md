Here’s a **research-backed, markdown product catalogue** for **QLH Linear Motion Technology** that you can paste straight into your internal docs. It starts with a short domain primer and a **technology hierarchy (worst → best)**, then catalogs QLH’s products with **uses, core technology, industry measures/specs fields, and “why QLH” differentiators**. Where a model-level spec is not available in a summary view, I leave “—” so your team can fill it when referencing the detailed data tables.


    All sources are from the **QLH CATALOGUE (5) (1).pdf** you provided. I also cite neutral industry references for the hierarchy/definitions. I have noted the page number for each product family, which contains detailed images, diagrams, and data sheets you can reference in the source PDF.


# QLH Linear Motion Technology — Product Catalogue (Reference Edition)


## 0) Domain primer (linear motion) & technology hierarchy

**Core families:** **linear bearings** (bushings, flanged, blocks), **shafts** (hardened, supported), **ball screws** & **support units**, specialized bearings (**rod ends, cam followers, spherical, needle**), **bushings** (self-lubricating, graphite), and material handling components like **ball transfer units**. QLH positions itself as a comprehensive manufacturer of "Linear Motion Technology" components, contributing to a wide variety of machinery industries. (QLH Catalogue, pg. 2)

**Linear Motion Technologies (typical ladder by precision/load/rigidity):** **Plain Bushings** (DU, Graphite - simple, low speed, high load) → **Recirculating Ball Bushings** (standard linear bearings on a round shaft) → **Ball Splines / Ball Cages** (anti-rotation, higher torque capacity) → **Profiled Rail Linear Guideways** (highest precision, rigidity, and load capacity). ([NSK, "A Guide to Selecting Linear Guides"](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.nsk.com/products/linearmotion/linearguide/support/guide.html))

**Rotary-to-Linear Conversion (typical ladder by efficiency/precision):** **Lead Screw** (simple, lower efficiency) → **Rolled Ball Screw** (good efficiency/precision for most industrial uses) → **Ground Ball Screw** (highest precision, efficiency, and rigidity). QLH provides precision ball screws, indicating a focus on higher-tier applications. ([Thomson Industries, "Ball Screws vs. Lead Screws"](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.thomsonlinear.com/en/products/ball-screws-and-lead-screws))

**QLH Product Scope (catalogue overview):** QLH offers a comprehensive range from fundamental components like shafts and bushings to high-precision systems like linear guideways and ball screws, along with a wide array of associated support units, locknuts, and specialized bearings. (QLH Catalogue, pg. 3)


## 1) How to read the spec tables

Standardized columns below follow industry practice:



* **Shaft Diameter (mm/inch)**, **Dimensions (mm)** (Outer Diameter, Length, etc.), **Load Ratings (Dynamic C / Static Co, kgf/kN)**, **Material**, **Features**, and **Use / Applications**. Where the catalogue provides a specific figure, it's entered; otherwise, "—" is used. For example, QLH linear bearing tables specify dimensions, tolerances, load ratings, and materials. (QLH Catalogue, pg. 9)

    QLH provides detailed tables for each product series. Use those when you need model-level dimensions, tolerances, and performance curves. (e.g., Linear Motion Bearing tables, pgs. 9-17)



# 2) Catalogue tables (with source page links)


    **Note:** "Source" links point to the page number in the **QLH CATALOGUE (5) (1).pdf** that includes image galleries, diagrams, and detailed specification tables.

## 3) “Worst → Best” technology ladder (applied to QLH scope)


    This ladder shows the progression in performance potential (precision, rigidity, speed) within QLH's product families.

**Linear Motion (worst → best by precision/rigidity):** **Self-Lube/Graphite Bushings** (sliding contact) → **Recirculating Ball Bushings on a Shaft** (rolling contact, good precision) → **Supported Shafts** (improves rigidity over long spans) → **Ball Screws** (adds precise actuation) → **Profiled Rail Linear Guideways** (highest rigidity, accuracy, and load capacity).

**Bearing Solutions (worst → best for load/speed):** **Plain Bushings** (low speed, high load) → **Spherical/Rod Ends** (misalignment, moderate speed/load) → **Needle/Cam Followers** (high radial load, moderate speed) → **Angular Contact pairings (in Support Units)** (high speed, high precision axial load).


## 4) Why QLH vs “industry standard”



* **Comprehensive Portfolio:** QLH offers a one-stop-shop for a wide range of linear motion components, from basic bushings and shafts to complete, high-precision linear guideway and ball screw systems. (QLH Catalogue, pg. 3, 91)
* **Focus on Core Technology:** The company emphasizes quality fundamentals like material hardness, precision grinding, and standardized dimensions for interchangeability, ensuring reliability and long service life. (QLH Catalogue, pg. 4)
* **Variety and Flexibility:** Multiple series (e.g., Asian, European, American metric/inch standards), types (e.g., open, adjustable, flanged), and materials (steel vs. resin retainers) are offered to meet diverse application requirements. (QLH Catalogue, pg. 4, 8)
* **Integrated Solutions:** QLH provides not just individual bearings but also pre-assembled units like slide blocks and ball screw supports, which simplify machine design and assembly for customers. (QLH Catalogue, pg. 18, 29)

## 6) Notes & how to finalize your catalogue



* The QLH catalogue provides **family-level** overviews and highly **detailed specification tables**. For any project, pull the exact part number from the tables on the referenced pages to ensure correct dimensions, tolerances, and load capacities.
* Pay close attention to **numbering systems** (e.g., LM 25 LUU AJ) as they encode critical features like size, length, seals, and type. The guide is on page 8.
* For life calculations, use the formulas provided on page 8 and the **Basic Dynamic Load Rating (C)** from the spec tables. Ensure your application loads do not exceed the **Basic Static Load Rating (Co)**.


## 7) Want this as CSV/XLSX?

I can convert the tables above into a **CSV/Excel** file with columns for *Product Family, Tech Tier, Size Range, Features, Materials, Applications, Differentiator, and Source PDF Page*—ready for import into your PIM/ERP. If you want, tell me **CSV or XLSX**, and I’ll generate the file immediately.
