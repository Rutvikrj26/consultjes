Awesome — here’s a **research-backed, markdown product catalogue** for **THM Huade** that you can paste straight into your internal docs. It starts with a short domain primer and a **technology hierarchy (worst → best)**, then catalogs THM Huade’s products with **uses, core technology, industry measures/specs fields, and “why THM/ Huade” differentiators**. Where a model-level spec is not published on the public pages, I leave “—” so your team can fill it when a datasheet is available.

> Sources are from THM Huade’s site and Huade’s official pages; I also cite neutral industry references for the hierarchy/definitions. I included **links to each product page (which contain images)** and, where available, links to **PDF data sheets** you can download.

# THM Huade — Product Catalogue (Reference Edition)

## 0) Domain primer (hydraulics) & technology hierarchy

**Core families:** hydraulic **pumps**, **motors**, **valves** (directional / pressure / flow / proportional / cartridge), **power units** & **mobile systems**, and **accessories/sensors**. Huade (Beijing Huade Hydraulic Group and affiliates/partners) has manufactured hydraulic components since the late 1970s and today supplies pumps, valves, motors and complete units. ([huade-hyd.com][1])

**Pump technologies (typical ladder by capability/efficiency):** **gear** (entry, robust/low cost) → **vane** (smoother/quieter) → **axial piston (swashplate)** → **bent-axis piston** (top efficiency & pressure). Use fixed vs variable displacement depending on duty cycle. ([Muncie Power Products][2])

**Motor technologies (typical ladder by torque/speed/efficiency):** **orbital/gerotor (LSHT)** → **gear**/**vane** → **axial piston** → **bent-axis piston** (high speed/efficiency/pressure). ([hyspeco.com][3])

**Valve technologies (control quality):** **on/off directional & pressure valves** → **proportional valves** (electro-proportional control of flow/pressure) → **servo valves** (highest precision, bandwidth). ([qualityhydraulics.com][4])

**THM Huade product scope (site overview):** THM lists product categories such as **track motors**, **cartridge & proportional flow valves**, **multi-way mobile valves**, **hydrostatic transmissions**, **linear actuators**, **gear pumps**, **mobile hydraulics**, and **sensors**; plus downloadable pump data sheets. ([thmhuade.com][5])

## 1) How to read the spec tables

Standardized columns below follow industry practice:

* **Displacement (cc/rev)**, **Rated/Peak pressure (bar)**, **Max speed (rpm)**, **Flow (L/min)**, **Efficiency (vol./mech./overall, %)**, **Port/Mounting** (ISO/SAE), **Control type** (fixed / variable, mechanical / electro-proportional), **Fluids & cleanliness** (e.g., NAS 1638), **Power**/**Voltage** (for integrated units), **Protection/IP**, **Weight/Envelope**, **Certs** (CE/UL), **Duty** (cont/intermittent), **Ambient/Fluid temps**. (Where a THM/ Huade page or PDF publishes the figure, it’s entered; otherwise “—”.) For example, Huade cartridge valve datasheets specify **max pressure up to 31.5 MPa (315 bar)** and **fluid cleanliness** requirements per **NAS 1638**. ([huadeonline.com][6])

> THM also provides PDFs such as **HY-catalog** (axial piston pump) and **IGP 02T internal gear pump series**; use those when you need model-level displacement/pressure curves. ([thmhuade.com][7])

# 3) “Worst → Best” technology ladder (applied to THM/Huade scope)

> The ladder below is about **core technology potential** (efficiency/pressure/dynamics), not a judgment on a specific model.

**Pumps (worst → best by typical capability):** **External/Internal Gear** → **Vane** → **Axial Piston (swashplate)** → **Bent-axis Piston**. Choose **variable displacement** to improve part-load efficiency where duty cycle varies. ([Muncie Power Products][2])

**Motors (worst → best for precision/speed/efficiency):** **Orbital/Gerotor (LSHT)** → **Gear / Vane** → **Axial Piston** → **Bent-axis Piston**. Use orbital for **low-speed/high-torque** tracks & wheels; use piston types for **higher speed/efficiency**. ([hyspeco.com][3])

**Valves (control quality):** **On/Off (directional, relief, reducing)** → **Proportional** → **Servo**. Use proportional for **stepless metering**; servo for **high bandwidth/precision** servo-hydraulic systems. ([qualityhydraulics.com][4])

## 4) Why THM / Huade vs “industry standard”

* **Breadth of portfolio** (pumps, valves, motors, power units) and legacy in **high-pressure** products; Beijing Huade’s history includes **Rexroth-derived technologies** and state-owned scale. ([huade-hyd.com][10])
* **Local applications & service** via THM Huade’s India presence (mobile hydraulics, component supply, service). ([thmhuade.com][9])
* **Downloadable PDFs** and product pages for selection (e.g., **IGP internal gear pumps**, **HY axial-piston pumps**, **M-SR cartridge valves**). ([thmhuade.com][8])

## 6) Notes & how to finalize your catalogue

* Many THM pages present **family-level** info; for a project/tender, pull the **datasheet PDFs** for exact **displacement, pressure curves, port/mount pattern, and efficiency**. (Start with the **IGP** and **HY** PDFs above.) ([thmhuade.com][8])
* For servo/proportional selection, align with your controller I/O (PWM/analog ±10 V), **spool overlap**, and **closed-loop feedback (LVDT)** as required by the cycle time of your machine. ([Power Motion Tech][16])
* For cleanliness and life, follow the **NAS 1638** class in the valve/pump sheet (typical: NAS 9 or better) and size filters accordingly. ([huadeonline.com][6])
