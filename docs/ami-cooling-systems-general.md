Here’s a **detailed, markdown-based product catalogue** for **AMI Cooling System** you can drop straight into your own catalogue. It begins with a short industry primer and technology hierarchy (so the product ladder makes sense), then lists AMI’s products with **specs, image links, uses, technology, and differentiators vs. “industry standard.”** I’ve only included quantitative specs that AMI (or its official distributor pages) explicitly publish; any fields not listed on their pages are left “—” (so you can fill them in later with project-specific data).

# AMI Cooling System — Product Catalogue (Reference Edition)

## 0) Industry primer (measures & technology hierarchy)

**How chillers are measured**

* **Capacity:** Tons of refrigeration (**TR**) and/or **kW** of cooling. (1 TR ≈ 3.517 kW). Efficiency is commonly expressed as **COP** or **EER** (higher = better). ([Energy.gov.au][1])
* **Heat rejection:** **Air-cooled** (fans reject heat to ambient air) vs **Water-cooled** (reject to condenser water + cooling tower). Water-cooled systems are **typically more energy-efficient** and support **larger capacities**, while air-cooled systems are simpler to install and maintain. ([Trane][2])
* **Compressor technology (common ladder):** **Scroll/reciprocating** (entry to mid, compact/low first cost) → **Screw** (industrial workhorse, wide operating range, better capacity control) → **Centrifugal** (highest single-unit capacities and top efficiencies for large plants). ([Huazhao Chiller][3])

**Practical tech hierarchy (worst → best, by typical efficiency/capability of the *core technology*, not brand):**
Air-cooled scroll/recip → Water-cooled scroll → Air-cooled screw → Water-cooled screw → Centrifugal. (Exact ranking depends on climate, loads, and controls, but this is the industry-typical gradient.) ([Trane][2])

## 1) How to read the spec tables

Each product table below uses standard columns:

* **Capacity (TR / kW)** – published cooling range on the product page.
* **Temp range** – leaving-fluid or application range, where listed.
* **Compressor** – type (scroll/recip/screw/centrifugal).
* **Condenser** – air vs water cooled.
* **Evaporator** – plate or **shell-and-tube** (listed where specified). ([amiacs.com][4])
* **Power / supply** – typical: **440 V, 3-phase, 50 Hz** on India-market models (as noted per page). ([amiacs.com][5])
* **Noise** – when AMI published it (e.g., ~**75 dB** on a 200 TR air-cooled unit). ([amiacs.com][5])
* **Use / Applications** – per AMI’s product descriptions.
* **Why AMI** – AMI’s differentiators (e.g., **tropicalized design**, **GSM remote monitoring** options, **stainless builds**). ([amiacs.com][5])
* **Image** – direct image URL for your catalogue; **Source** – the AMI (IndiaMART/official) product page used.

> AMI’s public catalogue and pages are accessible on **amicoolingsystem.com** and its **official IndiaMART microsite (amiacs.com)**, which lists detailed specs, options, and images. Where the corporate site blocks scraping, the IndiaMART pages are used as the canonical, company-managed source. ([amiacs.com][6])

## 3) GSM/remote monitoring options

Several **water chiller** listings include **“Water Chiller With GSM Systems / Automatic Water Chiller With GSM System”**—useful for **remote alarms, status, and basic control/monitoring** (great for unmanned plants or where uptime visibility is critical). Specs noted across AMI’s listings include **stainless-steel body** options and **automatic** control grades. ([amiacs.com][7])

---

## 4) Technology hierarchy (worst → best) applied to AMI’s range

1. **Air-cooled scroll/recip** (e.g., **Air Cooled Water Chillers**) → **lowest first cost**, simplest install; efficiency depends on **ambient dry-bulb**. ([amiacs.com][5])
2. **Water-cooled scroll** (e.g., **Water Chiller Plant / Automatic Water-Cooled**) → **step-up efficiency** via condenser water/tower (lower condensing temp). ([amiacs.com][7])
3. **Air-cooled screw** (e.g., **Air Cooled Screw Chiller**) → **better capacity control** and operating range; optional **low-temp (−10 °C)** variants. ([amiacs.com][5])
4. **Water-cooled screw** → **industrial workhorse** with strong part-load performance and higher system efficiency than air-cooled peers. ([amiacs.com][9])
5. **Centrifugal water chiller** → **largest capacities** & top lifecycle efficiency for major plants/campuses. ([amiacs.com][12])

## 5) Notes, assumptions & how to finalize your catalogue

* Where AMI lists **ranges** rather than per-model datasheets (e.g., “5–500 TR”), I’ve captured the **published bounds** and left model-level items “—”. For enterprise or tender use, request **model-specific data** (COP/IPLV, refrigerant, flow, pump head, tank size, footprint, MCA/MOP, EC fans, etc.).
* **Efficiency metrics (COP/EER/IPLV)** and **test conditions** should be compared apples-to-apples. (Common references & definitions provided above.) ([Energy.gov.au][1])
* Many AMI listings explicitly reference **tropicalized** design and **factory testing**—useful differentiators versus generic market offerings. ([amiacs.com][5])

## 7) Want this as a filled-out sheet?

I can convert the above into a **CSV/Excel** (one row per product family, with filterable columns: *TR, kW, temp range, compressor, condenser, evaporator, voltage, noise, use, differentiator, image URL, source link*), and add placeholders for **COP/IPLV, refrigerant, flow & head, tank volume** for your team to fill from project BOMs. If you’d like that now, tell me **CSV or XLSX** and I’ll generate it.
